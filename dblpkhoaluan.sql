For many purposes it is necessary to characterise and classify them, e.g. for regionalisation, prediction in ungauged catchments, model parameterisation. In this study, we investigate hydrological similarity of catchments with respect to their response behaviour. We analyse more than 8200 event runoff coefficients (ERCs) and flow duration curves of 53 gauged catchments in RhinelandPalatinate, Germany, for the period from 1993 to 2008, covering a huge variability of weather and runoff conditions. The spatio-temporal variability of event-runoff coefficients and flow duration curves are assumed to represent how different catchments “transform” rainfall into runoff. From the runoff coefficients and flow duration curves we derive 12 signature indices describing various aspects of catchment response behaviour to characterise each catchment. Hydrological similarity of catchments is defined by high similarities of their indices. We identify, analyse and describe hydrologically similar catchments by cluster analysis using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). As a result of the cluster analysis we get five clusters of similarly behaving catchments where each cluster represents one differentiated class of catchments. As catchment response behaviour is supposed to be dependent on its physiographic and climatic characteristics, we compare groups of catchments clustered by response behaviour with clusters of catchments based on catchment properties. Results show an overlap of 67 % between these two pools of clustered catchments which can be improved using the topologic correctness of SOMs.', 'Catchment,classification,runoff,behaviour,self,organizing,maps'),

In this study we defined nine hydrologically meaningful signature indices: five indices were sampled on the flow duration curve, four indices were closely linked to the distribution of event runoff coefficients. We applied these signature indices to the output from a hydrologic catchment model for three different catchments located in the Nahe basin (Western Germany) to detect differences in runoff behavior resulting from different meteorological input data. The models were driven by measured and simulated (COSMO-CLM) meteorological data. It could be shown that the application of signature indices is a very sensitive tool to assess differences in simulated runoff behavior resulting from climatic data sets of different sources. Specifically, the selected signature indices allow assessing changes in water balance, vertical water distribution, reactivity, seasonality and runoff generation. These indices showed that the hydrological model is very sensitive to biases in mean and spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation and temperature because it acts as a filter for the meteorological input. Besides model calibration and model structural deficits, we found that bias correction of temperature fields and further adjustment of bias correction of precipitation fields is absolutely essential. We conclude that signature indices can act as indirect “efficiency measures” or “similarity measures” for output from regional or local climate models.', 'Analysis ,projected ,hydrological ,behavior ,catchments ,based ,signature ,indices'),

As the size of the OBDDs and also the computation time depends on the order of the input variables, the verification may only succeed if a well suited variable order is chosen.

Unfortunately, dynamic reordering strategies are often very time consuming and sometimes do not provide any improvement of the OBDD representation. This paper presents adaptions of reordering techniques originally intended for combinatorial verification to the specific requirements of symbolic model checking.

The paper discusses two main problems, the first of which—the containment problem—arose from a question in abstract numerical analysis. Here the goal is to construct a polytope P(not necessarily in any sense a small one) that contains C, where this requires precise specification of the vertices of P. There are some sharp positive results for the case in which d = 2 and C is known not to be too asymmetric, but the main result on the containment problem is negative. It asserts that when d ≥ 3 and the body is known only to be rotund and symmetric, there is no algorithm for the containment problem. This is the case even when there is available a certain master oracle whose question-answering power far exceeds that of the ray-oracle. However, it turns out that even when there is no additional information about C, the following relaxation of the containment problem admits an algorithmic solution based solely on the ray-oracle: construct a polytope containing C or conclude that the centred condition number of C exceeds a prescribed bound.  In the other main problem—the reconstruction problem— it is known only that C is itself a polytope and the problem is to construct C with the aid of a finite number of calls to the ray-oracle. That is accomplished with a number of calls that depends on the number of faces (and hence on the ‘combinatorial complexity’) of C.', ''),

We show that these problems become decidable, if this assumption is abandoned. So, the (unrealistic) idealization from program verification “atomic execution of base statements” introduced in order to simplify matters, actually increases the difficulty of these problems from the point of view of program analysis: amazingly these problems become more tractable if we adopt a less idealized, more realistic model of execution.  We introduce an effective abstract domain of antichains of dependence traces that allows us to perform a precise interprocedural dependence analysis in (non-atomically executing) parallel programs. The main idea is to trace sequences of dependences exhibited successively by program executions. We define operations on antichains of dependence traces and show that they precisely abstract the corresponding operations on sets of non-atomic program executions. Using these operations, we can analyze dependences by means of an abstract interpretation of constraint systems that characterize sets of program executions of interest. The result of the dependence analysis can in turn be used to detect all copy constants and to eliminate faint code.  While the run-time of the algorithms is exponential in the number of program variables, it is polynomial in the program size. Hence, they are polynomial-time algorithms if the number of program variables is bounded. In order to justify their overall exponential run-time, we show that both detection of copy constants and elimination of faint code are intractable (NP-hard) even when the atomic execution idealization is abandoned.

The polytopeP is assumed to be presented as the convex hull of finitely many points with rational coordinates (V-presented) or as the intersection of finitely many closed halfspaces defined by linear inequalities with rational coefficients (ℋ-presented). The innerj-radius ofP is the radius of a largestj-ball contained inP; it isP\'s inradius whenj = n and half ofP\'s diameter whenj = 1. The outerj-radius measures how wellP can be approximated, in a minimax sense, by an (n — j)-flat; it isP\'s circumradius whenj = n and half ofP\'s width whenj = 1.

Special attention is paid to the case in whichP is centrally symmetric. When the dimensionn is permitted to vary, the situation is roughly as follows: (a) for general ℋ-presented polytopes in ℓ p spaces with 1<p<∞, all outer radius computations are NP-hard; (b) in the remaining cases (including symmetric ℋ-presented polytopes), some radius computations can be accomplished in polynomial time and others are NP-hard.

Since it is well known that OBDD\'s are restricted FBDD\'s (free BDD\'s, i.e., BDD\'s that test, on each path, each input variable at most once), and that FBDD-representations are often much more (sometimes even exponentially more) concise than OBDD-representations.

The problem remains NP-hard if one wants to construct an optimal OBDD-representation merely in such cases its size is bounded by a given constant. Both results remain true if the variable ordering of an optimal OBDD-representation is known in advance.  Reflecting these theoretical results and the requirements in the area of practical applications (above all in CAD of ciruits), the problem of construction of the minimal OBDD for a given variable ordering becomes of growing importance. We show that, starting with a free BDD (FBDD) P of a Boolean function f on X, for each ordering π of X, the minimal π OBDD- representation Q of f can be constructed output-efficiently, i.e. in time that is polynomial in the sizes of input and output.

Gurevich recently proposed a framework for semantics of programming concepts which directly reflects the dynamic and resource-bounded aspects of computation. This approach is based on (essentially first-order) structures that evolve over time and are finite in the same way as real computers are (so-called “dynamic algebras”).  We use dynamic algebras to give an operational semantics for Prolog which, far from being hopelessly complicated, unnatural or machine-dependent, is simple, natural and abstract and in particular supports the process oriented understanding of programs by programmers. In spite of its abstractness, our semantics is machine executable. It is designed for extensibility and as a result of the inherent extensibility of dynamic algebra semantics, we are able to proceed by stepwise refinement.  We give this semantics for the full language of Prolog including all the usual non-logical built-in predicates. We hope to contribute in this way to reducing the “mismatch between theory and practice… that much of the theory of logic programming only apply to pure subsets of Prolog, whereas the extra-logical facilities of the language appear essential for it to be practical” (Lloyd 1989). Our specific aim is to provide a mathematically precise but simple logical framework in which standards can be defined rigorously and in which different implementations may be compared and judged. This work is in applied logic and suggests several interesting new classes of problems in model theory.

Speaking of feature structures as linguistic types suggests to look at other areas where types have been studied for a long time: the world of abstract data type specifications. One immediately observes a number of similarities between feature types and data types. The major link is the concept of equality which plays a central role in both approaches. Taking this as the starting point, we employ the algebraic machinery known from abtract data type specifications to the Stuttgart Type Unification Formalism (STUF). STUF provides a powerful notation for handling feature graphs, and the algebraic characterization of STUF we present here contributes to the formal understanding of the formalism. By translating feature graphs into algebraic data type specifications we are able to define an algebraic semantics for feature graphs. The algebraic framework also provides simple and precise definitions of operations of STUF graphs such as unification, subsumption and equivalence. Moreover, by employing the Knuth-Bendix Algorithm, a well-known tool for normalizing systems of equations, the various consistency concepts used for feature graph descriptions can be described and tested easily.', ''),

Transactions which intend to modify the database perform integrity checks, which can be considered as a specific kind of read operations. These integrity checks (like other read operations) have to be synchronized with write operations of concurrent transactions. Since integrity checks often access large parts of the database, the synchronization of integrity checks with write operations is a major bottle-neck of transaction synchronization. We show that the synchronization of integrity checks with write operations of concurrent transactions can be substantially improved so that it allows for more parallelism.  The key idea of the improvement is that the scheduler uses the knowledge of whether or not a read operation is used for integrity checking, and if so, then the scheduler allows for more parallelism with write operations of concurrent transactions.  The improvement presented achieves a higher transaction concurrency and can be combined with other integrity check optimization techniques. Furthermore, the improvement is adaptable to various synchronization techniques, e.g. physical and predicative locking and validation. A scheduler using the presented improvement for both predicative locking and predicative validation is implemented within the DBPL database system which was developed at the University of Frankfurt.', ''),

This mechanism can be used to implement a filter module that sits on top of the database management system (DBMS) and offers clause retrieval functions to the PROLOG interpreter. The filter module accepts arbitrary complex goal literals as input and returns all clauses (potentially) matching the goal.  The presented mechanism is able to handle ground and non-ground facts as well as rules. For clause retrieval it derives search predicates from the constants of goal literals as well as multiple occurrences of goal variables.  The presented method is flexible enough to support a wide range of filter selectivity, i.e. it can be used to implement highly-selective as well as arbitrary coarse filters. The structures needed to represent clauses in the DBMS are simple: each clause is entirely stored in a single tuple, which also contains all information needed for selection purposes. To retrieve the clauses matching a given goal, one DBMS query operating on a single table is to be executed, independent of the complexity of the stored clauses and the degree of selectivity provided by the filter.An Effective Representation of Complex Clauses in a relational database', ''),
